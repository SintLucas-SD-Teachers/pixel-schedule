# Overview

Pixel Schedule is an interactive gamification platform for school schedule. Here you can see where each teacher is and which lesson is being taught in the classroom. It is linked to the Magister app and keeps us informed of changes through fun interactive effects and notifications.

# Installation

Due to sensitive data, you need to install the API on your device and log in to allow the webapp to access your rooster.

Here is the link where you can install:

After installation, you can view the Pixel Schedule at:

# For developers

The webapp is written in TypeScript using [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs) v7. When building the project, TypeScript files are compiles to JavaScript and all code is bundled into one minified file using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).
